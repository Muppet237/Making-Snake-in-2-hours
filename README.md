# Making Snake in 2 hours
 
I wanted to test myself. So I timed myself while making Snake.
Decided that older games with bare graphics are a good start for programming learning and testing.

Its not 100% complete, but im happy with it for only 2 hours of work in the middle of the night.
Also learned some stuff.
